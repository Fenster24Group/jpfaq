What does it do?
----------------

Simple Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) plugin with answers optional in categories. Made with Extbase en jQuery.  Since irFAQ gave me some problems on TYPO3 4.4+ I decided to build a new FAQ plugin.
New version 2.x includes a cool on the fly “while you type” searchform, improved and independent toggling of answers and all Javascript has moved to the footer.
Version 3.x is for TYPO3 6.2.
Version 4.x is a total refactoring and for TYPO3 7.6+
